Structural Meta Analysis of Welfare Reform Experiments

Here is an edit to the readme file. We want to see how it shows up.

Ideas to implement:

+ Since the strictness of implementation of work requirements is not clear, we should experiment with imposing them and not imposing them for each experiment. See which provides a better fit of the data.
+ Similarly, if there is a way to parameterize "employment services" outside of forcing a work requirement, we should think about that.
+ We need to think about how to combine the model with PSID data (get heterogeneity).
