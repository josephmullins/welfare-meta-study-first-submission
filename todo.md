# Estimation plan
## Version 1
- One wage per site
- heterogeneous α_H, α_P (by site)
- homogenous home productivity and relative price
- linear factor setup

## Version 2
- One wage per site
- heterogeneous α_H, α_P (by site)
- try heterogeneous home productivity and relative price (by site)
- linear factor setup
- Fit childcare expenditure on top of everything else

## Version 3
- One of the above, but put in wage distribution, using either ACS or CPS


# Things to prepare
## Baseline characteristics (collect)
List of baseline characteristics across sites
- Age of youngest child
- Earnings
- Education
- Spend on Childcare
- Welfare use (long-term) (important for LA-GAIN, part of sample selection)
- Age
- Racial Composition
- Hours
- Response rates for follow up surveys
- Overall sample sizes

## Local earnings/wage data
- We need to think about most appropriate sources of wage data (ACS vs CPS)
-

## School district finances
- Schooling inputs can distort
- Use [school district finance survey data](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/f33agency.asp)
- Want to test if this improves fit at all

# Wrinkles to baseline model
- Multiple skills
- Age-dependent parameters
- Potential differences in up vs down across skill types and ages
- School ages
