# Estimation plan
## Version 1
- One wage per site
- heterogeneous α_H, α_P (by site)
- homogenous home productivity and relative price
- linear factor setup

## Version 2
- One wage per site
- heterogeneous α_H, α_P (by site)
- try heterogeneous home productivity and relative price (by site)
- linear factor setup

## Version 3
- One of the above, but put in wage distribution, using either ACS or CPS
