# Estimation plan
## Version 1
- One wage per site
- heterogeneous α_H, α_P (by site)
- homogenous home productivity and relative price
- linear factor setup

## Version 2
- One wage per site
- heterogeneous α_H, α_P (by site)
- try heterogeneous home productivity and relative price (by site)
- linear factor setup
- Fit childcare expenditure on top of everything else

## Version 3
- One of the above, but put in wage distribution, using either ACS or CPS

# Things to prepare
## Baseline characteristics (collect)
List of baseline characteristics across sites
- Age of youngest child
- Earnings
- Education
- Spend on Childcare
- Welfare use (long-term)
- Age
- Racial Composition
- Hours

# Wrinkles to baseline model
- Multiple skills
- Age-dependent parameters
- Potential differences in up vs down across skill types and ages

# Available Data
## LA-GAIN
- Childcare:
- Youngest Child:
- Number of Children:
- Location:
-
## FTP
## MFIP
## CTJF
- Childcare:
- Youngest Child:
-- proportions in <2,3-5,6+
- Number of Children:
-- both mean and proportions 0(?),1,2,3,4+
- Location: Manchester and New Haven, CT

Other notes:
* Treatment effects are pooled across sites (need sample sizes)
* Time limits become salient at about 8 quarters (time limit)
