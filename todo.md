# Estimation plan
## Version 1
- One wage per site
- heterogeneous α_H, α_P (by site)
- homogenous home productivity and relative price
- linear factor setup

## Version 2
- One wage per site
- heterogeneous α_H, α_P (by site)
- try heterogeneous home productivity and relative price (by site)
- linear factor setup
- Fit childcare expenditure on top of everything else

## Version 3
- One of the above, but put in wage distribution, using either ACS or CPS


# Things to prepare
## Baseline characteristics (collect)
List of baseline characteristics across sites
- Age of youngest child
- Earnings
- Education
- Spend on Childcare
- Welfare use (long-term) (important for LA-GAIN, part of sample selection)
- Age
- Racial Composition
- Hours
- Response rates for follow up surveys
- Overall sample sizes

# Wrinkles to baseline model
- Multiple skills
- Age-dependent parameters
- Potential differences in up vs down across skill types and ages

# Available Data
## LA-GAIN
- Childcare:
  * Out of pocket and total for all, <6 and 6+
- Youngest Child:
  * proportions in <2,3-5,6+
- Number of Children:
  * both mean and proportions 1,2,3+
- Outcomes
  * 3-5, 6-9, 10-18 at time of assignment
- Location: LA-county, no more data than that?
  * May be able to weight by welfare participants

Other notes:
* Troubling sample design. "Priority" given to long-term recipients, never made clear what this is.
* However, we are given these sample proportions in the report
## FTP
## MFIP
- Childcare
  * Admin data on payments made by government (e.g. table 4.7 in Gennetian et al vol 1)
  * data on rates of formal care
  * Should be enough to impute subsidy (if used in combination)
- Youngest Child
  * proportions in <2,3-5,6+
- Number of Children
  * proportions 1,2,3+
- Outcomes
  * Urban counties only, separately by long-term vs recent
- Location
  * Hennepin, Anoka, and Dakota and four rural counties: Mille Lacs, Morrison, Sherburne, and Todd
  * Will focus only on urban counties

Other notes
* Very significant effect on marital stability of households. This is very interesting!
  - Appears to be excluded from our results, but we should follow up on this!
  - 19.1pp difference after 3 years!!

## CTJF
- Childcare:
  * % use (by age also), out of pocket totals, $ receipt of subsidy
- Youngest Child:
  * proportions in <2,3-5,6+
- Number of Children:
  * both mean and proportions 0(?),1,2,3,4+
- Outcomes:
  * 5-12, 13-17 at time of interview (3 years)
- Location: Manchester and New Haven, CT

Other notes:
* Treatment effects are pooled across sites (need sample sizes)
* Time limits become salient at about 8 quarters (time limit)

## NEWWS

# Other TODOs
- [ ] Come up with efficient way to present pertinent information, including differences in sample design
- [ ] Seems like common distinction between long-term recipient and recent applicant. Can we use this across all?
  * this may be a good task to put the kids onto
