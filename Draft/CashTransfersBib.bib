  abstract={ In this paper we present inference methods which are based on an 'incorrect' criterion, in the sense that the optimization of this criterion does not directly provide a consistent estimator of the parameter of interest. Moreover, the argument of the criterion, called the auxiliary parameter, may have a larger dimension than that of the parameter of interest. A second step, based on simulations, provides a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator of the parameter of interest. Various testing procedures are also proposed. The methods described in this paper only require that the model can be simulated, therefore they should be useful for models whose complexity rules out a direct approach. Various fields of applications are suggested (microeconometrics, finance, macroeconometrics). Copyright 1993 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Nevertheless, changing sample composition, aggregate shocks, the changing composition of the tax paying population, and discontinuities in the tax system create serious identification and estimation problems. We develop grouping estimators that address these issues. Our results reveal positive and moderately sized wage elasticities. We also find negative income effects for women with children.},

abstract = {Using an instrumental variables strategy, we estimate the causal effect of income on children’s math and reading achievement. Our identification derives from the large, nonlinear changes in the Earned Income Tax Credit. The largest of these changes increased family income by as much as 20 percent, or approximately \$2,100, between 1993 and 1997. Our baseline estimates imply that a \$1,000 increase in income raises combined math and reading test scores by 6 percent of a standard deviation in the short run. Test gains are larger for children from disadvantaged families and robust to a variety of alternative specifications. (JEL H24, H31, I21, I38, J13)},
